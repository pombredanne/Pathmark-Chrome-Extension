Here is where I sketch out my ideas for the Arachnid chrome extension.


Plan:

TODAY: set up user click event in popup -> pathmark created, default name (how do bookmarks do it?)
       use name of pathmark as key in sync storage for all the rest of pathmark
       Do some CSS stuff 

NEXT: D3 Visualization for graph
      allow user to choose refer/refer+time/just time pathmarks (others?)
      allow user to choose force-directed or timeline graph 
      (default in settings, still allow switch in real time)

Need to show options for the path to be marked:
1. get a path from history by time cluster - for all of these, show option
2. get a path from history by explicit links - option visualization should be pMark visual
3. use time cluster but also add any explicit linked tabs

Need to have a pathmark visualization

Need to allow visual reordering of pathmarks

Need to upload pathmarks to my servers
