Here is where I sketch out my ideas for the Arachnid chrome extension.


Plan:

1. Create graph from current session of chrome
2. Create visualization of graph
3. Make visualization interactive -> edit vis = edit actual path
4. Add heuristics to allow different kinds of pathmarks (from current tab, time, etc.)
5. Be low-level badasses


Need to show options for the path to be marked:
1. get a path from history by time cluster - for all of these, show option
2. get a path from history by explicit links - option visualization should be pMark visual
3. use time cluster but also add any explicit linked tabs

Need to have a pathmark visualization

Need to allow visual reordering of pathmarks

Need to have folders for pathmarks

Need to upload pathmarks to my servers 

TODO:
today - get a list for the path and display it

1 week - be able to put the lists into bookmark folders
3 week - implement visualization and visual reordering
4 week- have a backend to save all the stuff
