Pathmark Chrome Extension
---------
Pathmarks let you visualize your path through the web. You can choose to pathmark a page (get only the path to that website),
recent pages, or an entire browsing session.

Choosing to View Pathmarks displays a graph of visited pages represented by their favicons.

The default visualization locks the x-coordinate of each node in a position proportional to
the time the page was accessed with respect to other pages in the pathmark.

This constraint can be removed by hitting the Tab key. 

In the visualization:
* Mouse-over: displays the URL of the node
* Esc: quits out of the extension
* Tab: switches to a regular force-directed graph visualization (and back)
* Clicking on background: quits out of the extension
* Clicking on a node: opens the URL of the node in a new, inactive tab
* Dragging a node: repositions the node and fixes it in the new position

Spiderweb
---------
Each pathmark documents the sites a user navigated through before finding their desired information.

An optional setting in the Pathmarks extension allows users to anonymously send their pathmarks to Spiderweb.
Spiderweb aggregates the pathmarks to provide recommendations based on a given URL.

Installing the Pathmark Chrome Extension adds an item to the context menu accessed by right-clicking in any website.

To open the Spiderweb for any site:
1. Have the Pathmark extension installed in the Google Chrome browser
2. Right click on any page
3. Select "Follow the Spiders"
