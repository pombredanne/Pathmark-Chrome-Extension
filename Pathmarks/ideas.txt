Here is where I sketch out my ideas for the Arachnid project.


Plan:

Visualization:
1. Delete individual pathmarks
2. Blue to start, Red to end
3. Timeline - default visualization
4. Drag to connect nodes
5. Right click to remove nodes
6. Merge pathmarks?

Arachnid:
1. JSON strings to collect pathmarks?
2. Slider to show rings of suggestions
3. Pathmark aggregation -> 2 points for ends, 1 for just being in the same pmark
